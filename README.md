# WARNING

The master branch has documentation and an API that is not consistent with the version published on RubyGems.

For the latest Rubygems published version, please see https://github.com/mhenrixon/active_campaign/tree/v0.1.16

# Active::Campaign::Ruby

A simple wrapper for the ActiveCampaign API. Since their API seems to be
basically just form posts to their server don't complain here about the way it
works. The only thing we really changed was how results are wrapped and
returned and you can read more about that here.

## Installation

    gem 'active_campaign'
